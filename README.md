Aerodynamic loads in aerodynamic surfaces by Panel Methods

TODO List:
----------

-- 2D Flows:

	- Calculation of lifting force in a centralized routine.
	- Calculation of lifting moment.
	- Parametrization of deflected (aileron/flaps) surfaces.
	- Boundary layer solver.

-- 3D Flows:
	
	- Trapezoidal Wing discrete representation by 3D panels.
	- 3D Panel solver (+wake model).
	- 3D Panel solver validation.
	- extension to other wing configurations.
	- addition of tail surfaces.
